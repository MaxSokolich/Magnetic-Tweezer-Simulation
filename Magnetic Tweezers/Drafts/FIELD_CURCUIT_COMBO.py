#-------IMPORTANT--------This is what should be calculted for as              
the relutance of the air gap was calcualted from ANSYS simulation. It is hard to calculate this because
the magnetic field is spread out 

Thus the model will fail if pole diameter is 2 big for 2 reasons;  monopole approximation doesnt hold, 
it will be harder to model the magnetic curcuit and obtain the relationship between input current 
and magnetic flux

#HOPKINSONS LAW 
'''
basically equivlant to electrical crucit ohms law but for magnetic curcuits
magnetomotive force = phi * reluctance
voltage =  current * resistance

The magnetic flux through each pole can
therefore be determined according to the magnetic circuit. where pole and yoke reluctances
are neglected due to 4 orders of magnetiudde less signifcant than air gap
